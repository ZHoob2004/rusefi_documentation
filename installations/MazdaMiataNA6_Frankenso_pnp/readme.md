### Frankenso board was designed to be used on Mazda Miata NA6 as a plug-and-play solution


You would really need a wideband sensor. I suggest adding a pin into OEM connector at 3J. This pin is not used in OEM wiring,
this is between Red/White California-only wire and Lt Green/White Manual-only TPS wire.
 
 On Frankenso board just have a jumper between W48 top and W48 bottom.
